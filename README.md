# Coding with AI: Starter Project

This is the starter project for the Coding with AI tutorial at Macalester.
In about two hours, you'll build a small project with Claude Code.
You don't need an idea yet. Claude will help you find one.

## My project

**Crew Night Out** is a Java app that helps a friend group plan nights out.

- Each friend sets up a profile: what they like (food, bars, activities, live music, night out spots), their vibe and their budget.
- Enter a budget and get the places with the highest average fun that fit it.
- See which friends would most want to come along.
- After the night, everyone rates how fun it was (1-10). Ratings make future picks smarter.

Places, friends and ratings are saved in `places.csv`, `friends.csv` and `ratings.csv`.
Edit `places.csv` to add your own favorite spots.

To run it (from the project folder):

```
javac -d out src/*.java
java -cp out CrewNightOut
```

## Before you start

You need:

- Access to Claude. Accept the email invite from us before you start.
- A GitHub account.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub Desktop]([https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://desktop.github.com/download/) on your laptop.

## Set up

1. Fork this repo. Click **Fork** at the top right of this page.
2. Clone this repo in GitHub desktop.
3. Open the repo in VS Code.
4. TOpen a terminal: **Terminal > New Terminal**.
5. Install Claude Code. You only do this once.
   - Mac or Linux: `curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash`
   - Windows: `irm https://claude.ai/install.ps1 | iex`
6. Start up claude: `claude`

Stuck? Ask an instructor, or see the [setup guide](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/setup).

## Build your project

Say hi to Claude. It will walk you through four steps:

1. **Brainstorm** an idea that fits in two hours.
2. **Plan** it. Claude will ask you to turn on plan mode with **Shift+Tab**.
   Then it will ask you a few questions.
3. **Describe and sketch** it. Claude writes a short description under "My project" above.
   It also sets up a skeleton of your project. Then it helps you commit both.
4. **Build** it in small steps. Commit each time something works.

Press **Esc** to stop Claude at any time.

## Change Claude's personality

Claude talks like a pirate. Why? Open `CLAUDE.md` to find out.
Claude reads that file at the start of every session.

Once you get going, rewrite the "Personality" section of `CLAUDE.md`.
Then type `/exit` and run `claude` again to meet your new Claude.
